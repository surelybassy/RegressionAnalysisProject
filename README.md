## Project

You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

Objective

Your job is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

## SQL

There were a number of tasks and questions to answer in SQL. For this I use MySQL Workbench. After creating the database, I used the  import wizard to import the CSV file and then began to explore the data. My solutions to this can be found in the SQL folder of this repository.
