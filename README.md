# RegressionAnalysisProject

## Project

Using historical data from property sales in Washington state, USA, I have been ask to analyse and provide insight, as well as complete a number of specific tasks in SQL, Tableau and use Python to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

## My Approach

I initially approached the project by brainstorming and creating a Kanban board, listing all of the jobs that I thought needed to completed in order to fulfil all the requirements, but was very aware that I would probably encounter a number of problems along the way so wanted to follow Agile methodology to allow for flexibility and continuous improvement.

## SQL

There were a number of tasks and questions to answer in SQL. For this I use MySQL Workbench. After creating the database, I used the  import wizard to import the CSV file and then began to explore the data. My solutions to this can be found in the SQL folder of this repository.
